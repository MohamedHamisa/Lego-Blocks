# Lego-Blocks

You have an infinite number of 4 types of lego blocks of sizes given as (depth x height x width):

d	h	w
1	1	1
1	1	2
1	1	3
1	1	4
Using these blocks, you want to make a wall of height n and width m. Features of the wall are:

- The wall should not have any holes in it.
- The wall you build should be one solid structure, so there should not be a straight vertical break across all rows of bricks.
- The bricks must be laid horizontally.

How many ways can the wall be built?
